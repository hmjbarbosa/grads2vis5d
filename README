HISTORY

This project is an unofficial fork of the GrADS plain-binary to vis5d
format converter distributed with the good old vis5d+. 

More information about GrADS on their official webpage:

www.iges.org/grads/

More information about vis5d+ on their official webpage, but the
project's last update was on 2002-04-11. 

vis5d.sourceforge.net/

The original grads_2_vis5d.f fortran77 file can be found inside
contrib/grads directory. Unfortunately, it is completely undocumented
and don't even mention the authors. More over, it will not compile at
all on newer linux systems.

ABOUT THIS PROJECT

I have changed everything to Fortran 90, divided the original file
into meanfull modules and added new functionalities like pressure to
height conversion. Now it works with gfortran standard.
